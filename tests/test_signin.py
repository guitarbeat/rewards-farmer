"""Tests for signing a profile in from inside the container.

The sign-in exists because Chromium takes its cookie key from the operating
system: a profile signed in on a Windows or macOS host cannot be read by the
container, so the container's own Edge has to write it. That browser needs a
display, and the display needs to reach the user without anything installed on
the host.

Most of what can go wrong here is not the browser. It is picking the wrong
profile directory, publishing the screen somewhere it should not be published,
and leaving a SingletonLock behind when the browser is killed rather than
closed, which makes every later run look like the profile is open elsewhere.
